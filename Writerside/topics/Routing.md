# Auto Routing

Kobold Auto Routing uses [Ktor Type Safe Routing](https://ktor.io/docs/server-resources.html)  

We provide an API and Code Generation to automatically create Ktor Server Routes and wires together lambdas to process transactions.
This means you just need to structure your code how you want, you get routing and code for processing requests generated automatically for you.
